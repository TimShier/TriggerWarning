# Trigger Warning

This Chrome Extension is a project which looks to provide individuals with a means of managing and suppressing triggering content from their feeds, searches and threads.

## Participate

We'd love some help. Please contact us on info@citizenresearchcentre.org if you have some ideas, skills or time you can provide this project.

## Install

To install, go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/triggerwarning-alpha/befophidiekkecokjmakbnjgljojldhi and install but *Read Disclaimer below*.

## NOTE

In it's current version it soft blocks for dogs and hard blocks for cats. Settings will be brought back online shortly but a change to approach was needed which necessitated a bit of a re-think.

## Disclaimer

This project is in active development and, as such, may be unstable. Usage is entirely at your own risk and (at this stage) the developers nor CitizenResearchCentre recommend that you compile or install this unless you yourself are a developer - in which case, go wild, please just have a look at the code and last deploy to make sure it's safe to install.
